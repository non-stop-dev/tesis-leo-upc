## Link Prediction Metrics


| LinkPredMetric | An abstract class for computing link prediction retrieval metrics. |
| --- | --- |
| LinkPredMetricCollection | A collection of metrics to reduce and speed-up computation of link prediction metrics. |
| LinkPredPrecision | A link prediction metric to compute Precision @$k$,i.e.the proportion of recommendations within the top-$k$that are actually relevant. |
| LinkPredRecall | A link prediction metric to compute Recall @$k$,i.e.the proportion of relevant items that appear within the top-$k$. |
| LinkPredF1 | A link prediction metric to compute F1 @$k$. |
| LinkPredMAP | A link prediction metric to compute MAP @$k$(Mean Average Precision), considering the order of relevant items within the top-$k$. |
| LinkPredNDCG | A link prediction metric to compute the NDCG @$k$(Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain). |
| LinkPredMRR | A link prediction metric to compute the MRR @$k$(Mean Reciprocal Rank),i.e.the mean reciprocal rank of the first correct prediction (or zero otherwise). |
| LinkPredHitRatio | A link prediction metric to compute the hit ratio @$k$,i.e.the percentage of users for whom at least one relevant item is present within the top-$k$recommendations. |
| LinkPredCoverage | A link prediction metric to compute the Coverage @$k$of predictions,i.e.the percentage of unique items recommended across all users within the top-$k$. |
| LinkPredDiversity | A link prediction metric to compute the Diversity @$k$of predictions according to item categories. |
| LinkPredPersonalization | A link prediction metric to compute the Personalization @$k$,i.e.the dissimilarity of recommendations across different users. |
| LinkPredAveragePopularity | A link prediction metric to compute the Average Recommendation Popularity (ARP) @$k$, which provides insights into the model's tendency to recommend popular items by averaging the popularity scores of items within the top-$k$recommendations. |
