Transforms are a general way to modify and customize [Data](../generated/torch_geometric.data.Data.html#torch_geometric.data.Data) or [HeteroData](../generated/torch_geometric.data.HeteroData.html#torch_geometric.data.HeteroData) objects, either by implicitly passing them as an argument to a [Dataset](../generated/torch_geometric.data.Dataset.html#torch_geometric.data.Dataset), or by applying them explicitly to individual [Data](../generated/torch_geometric.data.Data.html#torch_geometric.data.Data) or [HeteroData](../generated/torch_geometric.data.HeteroData.html#torch_geometric.data.HeteroData) objects:


```
import torch_geometric.transforms as T
from torch_geometric.datasets import TUDataset

transform = T.Compose([T.ToUndirected(), T.AddSelfLoops()])

dataset = TUDataset(path, name='MUTAG', transform=transform)
data = dataset[0]  # Implicitly transform data on every access.

data = TUDataset(path, name='MUTAG')[0]
data = transform(data)  # Explicitly transform data.
```
