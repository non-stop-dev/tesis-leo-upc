    "## Introduction to Graphs ##\n",
    "A graph is a type of data structure that contains **nodes** and **edges**. A node can be a person, place, or thing, and the edges define the relationship between nodes. Edges can be directed, where an edge has a source node and a destination node. They can also be undirected, where there is no notion of source or destination nodes. Graphs are excellent in dealing with complex problems with relationships and interactions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data that are naturally represented by graphs include: \n",
    "* **Citation networks** can be used to study how publications relate to each other. \n",
    "* **Social networks** are tools to study patterns in collective behavior of people, institutions, and organizations. A social network graph represents groups of people by modelling individuals as nodes, and their relationships as edges. \n",
    "* **Molecules** can be described as a graph, where nodes are atoms and edges are the bonds they share. \n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of graphs can vary greatly in terms of the number of nodes, edges, and the connectivity of nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the properties that make graphs different from other types of data include: \n",
    "1. A graph exists in non-Euclidean space, which makes it harder to interpret the data. To visualize the data, there are various dimensionality reduction tools. \n",
    "2. Graphs are unstructured and do not have a fixed form. \n",
    "3. Their large size and high dimensionality increase the complexity for human interpretation. "

    "In this lab, we will use the open-source Deep Graph Library, [DGL](https://www.dgl.ai/), and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) to work with graph data. Other popular graph deep learning libraries include [Spektral](https://graphneural.network/), [Graph Nets](https://www.deepmind.com/open-source/graph-nets), and [PyTorch Geometric](https://www.pyg.org/), which allow us to manipulate graph data in similar ways. \n",
    "\n",
    "DGL represents each node by a unique integer, known as a node ID, and each edge by a pair of integers corresponding to the IDs of its end nodes. DGL assigns each edge a unique integer, known as edge ID, based on the order in which it was added to the graph starting with `0`. In DGL, all edges are directed, and an edge `(u, v)` indicates that the direction goes from source node `u` to destination node `v`. When making **undirected** graphs, edges can be treated as **bidirectional** by adding **reverse edges**. \n",

Once created, we can use [`dgl.DGLGraph.nodes()`](https://docs.dgl.ai/en/0.8.x/generated/dgl.DGLGraph.nodes.html), [`dgl.DGLGraph.edges()`](https://docs.dgl.ai/en/0.8.x/generated/dgl.DGLGraph.edges.html), or [`dgl.DGLGraph.edge_ids(u, v)`](https://docs.dgl.ai/generated/dgl.DGLGraph.edge_ids.html) to reference the nodes and edges. Edges can also be identified using [`dgl.DGLGraph.find_edges(eid)`](https://docs.dgl.ai/en/0.8.x/generated/dgl.DGLGraph.find_edges.html), [`dgl.DGLGraph.in_edges(v)`](https://docs.dgl.ai/en/0.8.x/generated/dgl.DGLGraph.in_edges.html), or [`dgl.DGLGraph.out_edges(u)`](https://docs.dgl.ai/en/0.8.x/generated/dgl.DGLGraph.out_edges.html). For finding the node degree, or the number of connections, we can use [`dgl.DGLGraph.in_degrees(v)`](https://docs.dgl.ai/en/0.8.x/generated/dgl.DGLGraph.in_degrees.html) or [`dgl.DGLGraph.out_degrees(u)`](https://docs.dgl.ai/en/0.8.x/generated/dgl.DGLGraph.out_degrees.html).

    "Before we can use the dataset for machine learning, we will perform data splitting for model validation. The original dataset contains 169,343 nodes and 1,116,243 edges. We will split the data based on the publication dates of the papers. By training the model on older papers, we can then use it to predict the labels for newly-published papers. This could provide tremendous value for the arXiv moderators. Given the range of history our data contains, we will train on papers published until 2017, validate on those published in 2018, and test on those published since 2019. The OGB dataloader conveniently provides the `train`, `valid`, and `test` masks for us directly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we'll first work with a subset of the data for the purpose of demonstration. Specifically, since we will be using the dense adjacency matrix to build our first GNNs, our memory capacity allows only a subset of the nodes. DGL provides a convenient [`dgl.DGLGraph.subgraph(nodes)`](https://docs.dgl.ai/en/0.2.x/generated/dgl.DGLGraph.subgraph.html) function to help us achieve this. We can obtain the node/edge mapping from the subgraph to the original graph by looking into the node feature `dgl.NID` or edge feature `dgl.EID` in the new graph. `subgraph` also copies the original features to the subgraph. Once we understand how GNNs work, we will be able to train with the sparse adjacency matrix for the entire dataset. \n",

    "### Message Passing and Graph Convolution ###\n",
    "**Message passing** is when each node in a graph sends information about itself to its neighbors and receives messages back from them to update its status and understand its environment. It enables graph neural networks to explore a graph's connectivity by correlating messages (features), sent by neighboring nodes, to update a node's features. The message passing feature is the core of DGL library and most graph computations in DGL rely on it. Message passing can be seen as two major steps: \n",
    "1. The first step consists of the \"message\" stage, where the messages are sent over or scattered by the nodes to its neighbors. It is performed for all existing or relevant edges in the graph.  \n",
    "2. The second step is the \"reduce\" stage, where the messages are **aggregated** by the receiving node and used to update its features. It is performed for all existing or relevant nodes in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Graph [convolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution)** combines information from neighborhoods and encodes updated node features to *latent representations*. It can be achieved based on a simple message passing mechanism that involves a linear combination of neighborhood features where weights used for the aggregation depend only on the structure of the graph. \n",
    "* An [embedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding) is a relatively low-dimensional space into which we can translate high-dimensional vectors such that similar items are close to each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will demonstrate these basic mechanisms through various node classification graph neural networks. Node classification, in simple words, refers to the task of predicting the labels of specific nodes by assessing the features and information from neighboring nodes. \n",

By stacking `N` GCN layers, the feature representations are updated with information of nodes up to `N` hops away. This is often treated as a hyperparameter for model tuning. \n",

    "_Note: The `in_feats`, `out_feats`, `norm` arguments in `GraphConv` are all we need to consider with this simple approach. Furthermore, we use the same `h_feat` hidden size of all 3 layers. For the `norm` argument, we can use `right` to divide the aggregated messages by each node’s in-degrees, which is equivalent to averaging the received messages. Alternatively, we can use `none`, where no normalization is applied, or `both` (default), where the messages are scaled using symmetric normalization._ "
